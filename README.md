# Phipps Conservatory site redesign

This exercise aims to redesign the web design and experience of the Phipps website. My goal was to attract more local college students to visit and volunteer at the conservatory. This prototype acts as a landing-site to compliment Phipps' original website. I wrote this site with minimal use of outside frameworks as a learning challenge!
